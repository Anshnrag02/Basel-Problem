# Basel-Problem
MA101 SEM 1 PROJECT

The given project is based on the concept of convergence of the Basel Problem i.e., the infinite summation of the inverse of n squared, where n varies from 1 to infinity.  

 

The project will be focusing on solving the problem by the intuitive method (the first ever solution to the problem), using trigonometric functions. We will be approximating the value using a computer program based on iteration. 

Finally, we will visualize the Asymptotic Graph of the value to understand convergence and finally apply it in a computational analysis to calculate the value of pi and check error.
